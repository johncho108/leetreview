LeetReview is an online, publically viewable coding journal intended to help users reflect on, and learn from, their solutions to DS/Algo challenges commonly found in technical interviews and coding competitions. Upon creating an account and logging in, users are able to create, modify, or delete their own solutions to problems. In addition, users are able to search or browse for other users' solutions and to suggest feedback to other users' solutions. 

LeetReview is built on a Django backend (to handle accounts/authentication and user posts/comments) and a simple Bootstrap frontend for responsiveness. It is currently deployed at leetreview.herokuapp.com. To test out user functionality, log in with user id: test and password: testword1. 

Thanks for dropping by!
